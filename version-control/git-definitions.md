# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It is a repository of all changes that have happened to a git. It exists in the cloud so that if anything bad happens to your computer, the code is safe and sound. It is also the process of creating branches off a master branch so that the original code in the master does not get lost. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one? 
To keep the integrity of the master branch intact, and create changes on the branch, which is a copy of the master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is like a save point, and a good commit message is succint and to the point about why the change was made and what it is good for.

* What is a merge conflict?
When changes conflict and then become merged into the master branch.
